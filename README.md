# QR-Work-Tracker

This is an app to allow construction site employees to easily input their completed work and to export it to an external database where it can be sorted into monthly spreadsheets.


## Motivation

I have decided to create this project to help companies save time off working out employee payrolls by moving away from paper time sheets and to an easy to use app.


## Tech/framework used

Built with Xamarin.Forms.

<b>Using</b>
- Prism.Unity.Forms
- ZXing.Net.Mobile.Forms
